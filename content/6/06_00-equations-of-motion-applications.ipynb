    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5.2\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be shown that, for periodic motion, the abbreviated action $I=\\oint pdq$ will remain constant, even if the Hamiltonian contains time-dependent parameters.  In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the abbreviated action is given by $I=E/\\omega$, where $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$. Thus, according to this relation, the initial energy and final energy, after slowly changing a system parameter, will be related as $\\frac{E_0}{\\omega_0}=\\frac{E_1}{\\omega_1}$.  Using the techniques developed in this class, find the energy of a simple harmonic oscillator if the spring constant is slowly increased over time, where the final value is twice the initial.  Repeat the calculation by changing $k$, such that the final value is reached after $10^n$ periods ($n=-2, -1,...,4$). For each rate of change in $k$, how close is the energy to the analytical result?"

    "In Phys 7301, we often considered motion of a particle in a central potential given by $$V=\\frac{k}{r}+\\frac{k'}{r^2}$$  Using Action-Angle variables, it can be shown that for specific values of $k$ and $k'$, the orbit would be closed (i.e. n oscillations along r and m rotations in $\\theta$).  For simplicity, consider a particle of unit mass, where $k=1$.  Calculate and visualize the trajectory for 5 different values of $k'$ for which the orbit is closed (i.e. the particle returns to the exact same point in phase space at a later time). "

We will discuss the analytical result in class."
